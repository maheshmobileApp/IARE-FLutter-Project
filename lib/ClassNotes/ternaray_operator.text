The ternary operator is like if-else statement.
This is a one-liner replacement for the if-else statement.

condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse; 

/*
var age = 11;
var condition = age >= 18;
if(condition){
    print("you are voter);
}else{
    print("you are not voter)
}
*/

age >=18 ? print("your are voter") : print("your are not voter")

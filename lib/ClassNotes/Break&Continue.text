Break : Sometimes you will need to break out of the loop immediately without checking the condition. you can use the break statement 

for(var i = 0;i<=10;i++) {

    print(i);
    if(i==5){
        break;
    }
}

0.......5 

Continue : Sometimes you will need to skip an iteration for specific condition you can you continue statement.

for(var i = 0;i<=10;i++) {

   
    if(i==5){
        continue;
    }
     print(i);
}
